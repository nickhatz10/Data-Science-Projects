This project uses an unsupervised learning technique called a Gaussian Mixture Models. The goal of this project is to assign genetic sample data from 
dogs to one of four different breeds of dogs. I predicted the probability of each genetic sample of a dog belonging to the four different breeds of dogs.
Since this is unsupervised the model doesn't have any labels so it uses clusters to group similar genetic samples of dogs together and 
predicts the breed of dog based on which cluster the genetic sample belongs to.
