This project uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict the probability that the next flip of a coin is going to be heads.
The dataset is comprised of 100,000 rows of different coin flips scenarios. Each coin flip scenario contains the results of 9 coin flips
and the goal is to predict the probability that the 10th coin flip would be heads.
