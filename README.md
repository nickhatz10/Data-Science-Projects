# Data Science Projects
Compilation of some machine learning projects I have worked on. These projects are coded using Python. The stucture of each of the folders can be found below.


# Project Directory Structure:
<pre>
|--project_name                             <- Root level of the project that was uploaded into GitHub.
    |--Data                                 <- Contains the different data used in the various projects.
        |--original_raw_data                <- Contains the original state of the data before it was preprocessed.
        |--preprocessed_data                <- Contains the data that was preprocessed and cleaned using Python in order to get it ready for the ML model.
    |--Python Files                         <- Contains the code written in Python for the machine learning project.
    |--description.txt                      <- Brief description of the project.
