# Data Science Projects
Compilation of some machine learning projects I have worked on. These projects are coded using Python. The stucture of each of the folders can be found below.


# Project Directory Structure:
<pre>
|--project_name                           <- Root level of the project that was uploaded into GitHub
  |--Python Files                         <- Folder containing the code written in Python for the machine learning project
  |--Data
    |--original_raw_data                  <- Folder containing the original state of the data before it was preprocessed
    |--preprocessed_data                  <- Folder containing the data that was preprocessed and cleaned using Python in order to get it ready for the ML model.
